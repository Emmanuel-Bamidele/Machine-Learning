#CNT Geometry prediction

The dataset used in training and testing the different models were obtained using Materials Studio. 
The results obtained show promising capabilities of the applied algorithms, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. 
NN, GBR and LR are the best performing algorithms with 99.3%, 99.3% and 99.13% respectively. 
ETR, DTR, and KNN gave the lowest accuracy of 94.47%, 94.49%, and 94.60% respectively.

Unlike computational methods that takes a long time to calculate the geometry, machine learning techniques offer faster and more efficient ways to accurately 
predict the geometry of carbon nanotubes. Some areas of application of our findings include biological and biomedical, nanocomposites, nanoelectronics, 
nanodevices, among others.
